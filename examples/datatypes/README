This example demonstrates the different available data types
that can be handled by WFC.

To generate code for this example, run:
../../bin/wfc datatypes.wfc

Take a look at the generated datatypes.h to learn what interfaces are generated
to handle the data. The file datatypes.cpp contains the complete
implementation. So for integration into a project only this .cpp file and the
relevant .h file must be included into the build process. The generated code
only relies on include of the standard C++ library, which should be included
per default on most systems when using a C++ compiler.
